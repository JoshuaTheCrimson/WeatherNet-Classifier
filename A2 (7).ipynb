Once you have logged in with GitHub, you may need to select your email address to associate your GitHub account with your email address (if you haven't done it in a previous COMP3420 activity). If you can't find your email address, please skip this step and contact diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au so that he can do the association manually.\n",

    "## Decision Choices Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Model Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: \n",
    "    - Introducing **one or more hidden layers** increases the model's capacity to learn complex patterns from the data.\n",
    "    - A **deeper model** (with more layers) can capture a wider variety of features at different levels of abstraction, which is particularly useful for complex classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropout**: \n",
    "    - **Dropout** is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    - By **randomly setting the output features of a layer to zero** at each update during training, it forces the network to learn robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons.\n",
    "    - This improves the model's **generalization ability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dense Layer Sizes**: \n",
    "    - The **number of units** in each dense layer (i.e., the layer's size) affects the model's capacity.\n",
    "    - More units can allow the model to learn more complex representations but can also lead to overfitting.\n",
    "    - Tuning this hyperparameter helps find a balance between underfitting and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Keras Tuner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Optimization**:\n",
    "    - Keras Tuner automates the process of selecting the best hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "    - It explores a specified range of values for each hyperparameter (e.g., number of hidden layers, sizes of hidden layers, dropout rate, learning rate) and evaluates model performance for each combination.\n",
    "    - This systematic approach helps in finding the optimal model configuration without manual trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice of Parameters for Tuning**:\n",
    "    - **Number of Hidden Layers & Sizes of Hidden Layers**: These parameters significantly impact the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. Tuning them allows us to explore various model complexities.\n",
    "    - **Dropout Rate**: Adjusting the dropout rate helps in finding the right amount of regularization, balancing the model's ability to learn from the training data without overfitting.\n"
